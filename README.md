Welcome to my version of a Pokedex:

To run thise program, please run index.html as a live server from an IDE such as vscode.

This project was an exciting and adventurous one to explore. From fully learning how to utilize new languages to me was a great opertunity to grow as a developer. In this project you can select from your choice of the original 151 Pokemon and get their data. This is done through the utizilzation of Pokeapi.co, which provide deep data into each and every pokemon fact that you would ever need to know.
